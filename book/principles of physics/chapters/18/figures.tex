whose electrical resistance is measured and displayed.}

(b) Body $T$ and body $B$ are also in thermal equilibrium,
at the same reading of the thermoscope.
(c) If (a) and (b) are true, the zeroth law of thermodynamics states
that body $A$ and body $B$ are also in thermal equilibrium.}

A triple-point cell, in which solid ice, liquid water, and water
vapor coexist in thermal equilibrium.
By international agreement, the temperature of this mixture has been
defined to be $273.16\,\mathrm{K}$.

\DeclareFigure{temperatures_measured_by_a_constant-volume_gas_thermometer}{\temperaturesmeasuredbyaconstantvolumegasthermometer}{
Temperatures measured by a constant-volume gas thermometer,
with its bulb immersed in boiling water.
For temperature calculations using \autoref{eq:provisional_ideal_gas_temperature},
pressure $p_3$ was measured at the triple point of water.
Three different gases in the thermometer bulb gave generally different
results at different gas pressures, but as the amount of
gas was decreased (decreasing $p_3$),
all three curves converged to $373.125\,\mathrm{K}$.}

\DeclareFigure{concorde}{\concorde}{
When a Concorde flew faster than the speed of sound,
thermal expansion due to the rubbing by passing air increased the aircraft's
length by about $12.5\,\mathrm{cm}$.
(The temperature increased to about $128\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$
at the aircraft nose and about $90\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$
at the tail, and cabin windows were
noticeably warm to the touch.)}

(a) A bimetal strip, consisting of a strip of brass and
a strip of steel welded together, at temperature $T_0$.
(b) The strip bends as shown at temperatures above this
reference temperature. Below the reference temperature
the strip bends the other way.
Many thermostats operate on this principle,
making and breaking an electrical contact
as the temperature rises and falls.}

The same steel ruler at two different temperatures.
When it expands, the scale, the numbers, the thickness,

by the same factor. (The expansion has been exaggerated for clarity.)}

(a) The shaded area represents the work $W$ done by a system as it goes from
an initial state $i$ to a final state $f$. Work $W$ is positive because
the system's volume increases. (b) $W$ is still positive, but now greater.
(c) $W$ is still positive, but now smaller. (d) $W$ can be even smaller
(path $icdf$) or larger (path $ighf$). (e) Here the system goes
from state $f$ to state $i$ as the gas is compressed to less volume by
an external force. The work $W$ done by the system is now negative.
(f) The net work $W_{\mathrm{net}}$ done by the system during a complete cycle
is represented by the shaded area}
